## SQLCipher

SQLCipher is an SQLite extension that provides transparent 256-bit AES encryption of 
database files. Pages are encrypted before being written to disk and are decrypted 
when read back. Due to the small footprint and great performance itï¿½s ideal for 
protecting embedded application databases and is well suited for mobile development.
